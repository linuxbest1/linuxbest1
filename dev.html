        <p id="about" class="admin">The trailer for GTA 6 dropped earlier this week, and one of the lines I read over
            and
            over
            again is that “it
            looks
            like a photograph”. I can only assume these people have never seen a photograph in their lives,
            because no,
            it
            doesn’t. Much like The Last of Us Part 1 remaster, it looks like a very impressive video game that
            is still,
            nonetheless, a video game. Both Rockstar and Naughty Dog have a habit of polishing their best work
            to sell
            minor
            improvements back to us, but after GTA 6 we will eventually get GTA 6. And what does that look like?

            Vice City and
            beyond in the
            biggest, most immersive evolution of the Grand Theft Auto series yet. Coming 2025 to PlayStation 5

        <h3 class="aboutgta5" id="aboutgta5">Grand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar
            North and
            published by Rockstar Games. It is
            the seventh main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV, and the
            fifteenth
            instalment overall. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas, based on Southern California, the
            single-player story
            follows three protagonists—retired bank robber Michael De Santa (Ned Luke), street gangster Franklin
            Clinton (Shawn
            Fonteno), and drug dealer and gunrunner Trevor Philips (Steven Ogg), and their attempts to commit
            heists while under
            pressure from a corrupt government agency and powerful criminals. Players freely roam San Andreas's
            open world
            countryside and fictional city of Los Santos, based on Los Angeles.</h3>
        <h3 class="aboutgta5-2">The game world is navigated on foot and by vehicle, from either a third-person or
            first-person
            perspective. Players
            control the protagonists throughout single-player and switch among them, both during and outside
            missions. The story is
            centred on the heist sequences, and many missions involve shooting and driving gameplay. A "wanted"
            system governs the
            aggression of law enforcement response to players who commit crimes. In Grand Theft Auto Online, the
            game's online
            multiplayer mode, up to 30 players engage in a variety of different cooperative and competitive game
            modes.</h3>
        <h3 class="aboutgta5-3">Shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide, the game's development began around
            the time of
            Grand Theft Auto
            IV's release. The developers drew influence from many of their previous projects (such as Red Dead
            Redemption and Max
            Payne 3) and designed the game around three lead protagonists to innovate on the core structure of
            its predecessors.
            Much of the development work constituted the open world's creation, and several team members
            conducted field research
            around California to capture footage for the design team. The game's soundtrack features an original
            score composed by a
            team of producers who collaborated over several years. Grand Theft Auto V was released in September
            2013 for the
            PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, in November 2014 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, in April 2015 for
            Windows, and in March
            2022 for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</h3>
        <h3 class="aboutgta5-4">Extensively marketed and widely anticipated, the game broke industry sales records and
            became the
            fastest-selling
            entertainment product in history, earning $800 million in its first day and $1 billion in its first
            three days. It
            received critical acclaim, with praise directed at its multiple-protagonist design, open world,
            presentation and
            gameplay. However, its depiction of violence and women caused controversies. Several gaming
            publications awarded the
            game year-end accolades including Game of the Year awards. In retrospect, it is considered one of
            seventh and eighth
            generation console gaming's most significant titles and among the best video games ever made. It is
            the
            second-best-selling video game of all time with over 190 million copies shipped, and one of the most
            financially
            successful entertainment products of all time, with over $8.5 billion in worldwide revenue. Its
            successor, Grand Theft
            Auto VI, is scheduled to be released in 2025.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="aboutgta5-5">Gameplay
            Grand Theft Auto V is an action-adventure game played from either a third-person or
            first-person perspective.
            Players complete missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the story.
            Outside of the
            missions, players may freely roam the open world. Composed of the San Andreas open countryside area,
            and its fictional
            Blaine County and city of Los Santos, the world is much larger in area than earlier entries in the
            series. It may
            be fully explored after the game's beginning without restriction, although story progress unlocks
            more gameplay
            content.</h3>
